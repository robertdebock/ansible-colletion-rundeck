Add custom services to your Linux system.

Example Playbook
----------------

This example is taken from `molecule/resources/playbook.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  vars:
    service_list:
      - name: simple-service
        description: Simple Service
        start_command: /usr/bin/sleep 3600
      - name: forking-service
        description: Forking Service
        type: forking
        start_command: "/usr/bin/sleep 7200 &"
      - name: specific-stop-service
        description: Specific Stop Service
        start_command: /usr/bin/sleep 14400
        stop_command: killall -f "sleep 1440"
      - name: specific-user-group-service
        description: Specific User Group Service
        start_command: /usr/bin/sleep 28800
        user_name: root
        group_name: root
      - name: specific-workingdirectory-service
        description: Specific WorkingDirectory Service
        start_command: /usr/bin/sleep 57600
        working_directory: /tmp
      - name: specific-pattern-service
        description: Specific Status Pattern Service
        start_command: /usr/bin/sleep 115200
        status_pattern: 115200

  roles:
    - robertdebock.service
```

The machine you are running this on, may need to be prepared.
```yaml
---
- name: Prepare
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  become: yes
  serial: 30%

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.bootstrap
```

Also see a [full explanation and example](https://robertdebock.nl/how-to-use-these-roles.html) on how to use these roles.

Role Variables
--------------

These variables are set in `defaults/main.yml`:
```yaml
---
# defaults file for service

# status_list can contain a list of services to add to the system.
# The mandatory items for each item are:
# - name: The (short) name of the service, i.e. "tomcat".
# - description: A bit longer name, i.e. "Tomcat application server".
# - start_command: The command to start the daemon,
#   i.e. "/usr/local/bin/java -jar some.jar"
# The optional items are:
# - stop_command: By default the program that is started is found and stopped.
#   in case a running program is renamed or expanded (including a path) during
#   startup, you can specify a custom stop command here, i.e. "pkill foo"
# - status_pattern: What program (or pattern) to look for when finding the
#   status of a program, i.e. "artifactory".
# - type: How the program starts; "simple" or "forking". Simple means the
#   program runs on the foreground, i.e. "nc -l 1234". Forking means the
#   program itself forks, i.e. "nc -l 12345 &"
# - working_directory: The directory to cd into before starting the service.
```
