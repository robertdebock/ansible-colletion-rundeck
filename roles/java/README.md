java
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robertdebock/ansible-role-java.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robertdebock/ansible-role-java)

Install and configure java on your system.

Example Playbook
----------------

This example is taken from `molecule/default/playbook.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - role: robertdebock.java
      # You can use specific version, depending on the distributions
      # use 7, 8, 9, 10 or 11. (The default is 8, this next line is
      # just an example.
      java_version: 8
      # You can also install multiple versions, but be aware that one
      # version is selected using `alternatives`. /usr/bin/java links
      # to the latest installed version.
      # - role: robertdebock.java
      #   java_version: 9
```

The machine you are running this on, may need to be prepared. Tests have been done on machines prepared by this playbook:
```yaml
---
- name: Default
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: no
  become: yes
  serial: 2

  roles:
    - robertdebock.bootstrap
```
